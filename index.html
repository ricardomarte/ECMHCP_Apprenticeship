<a name="TOP"></a><H1 style="text-align:center;">Early Childhood Mental Health Collective Project (ECMHCP)</H1>	
<H2>Paid Undergraduate Mental Health Apprenticeships</H2>
		
		
		
The Early Childhood Mental Health Collective Project is a collaborative effort to address the mental health needs of children from birth to the age of five.  To accomplish this goal, the organizations in the ECMHCP (i.e., referred to as "The Collective")  are partnering with five local early learning programs to develop individualized intervention systems and to collect, analyze, and report evidence of the effectiveness of these interventions.  To best accomplish these additional objectives, The Collective will ensure that the families and staff at the local learning programs are well supported by building their capacity to provide early childhood mental health services.  This is where you come in. 

The ECMHCP will recruit and place 15 (bachelor’s degree seeking) undergraduate students known as Apprentices, from UKMC across the five early learning programs. The ideal apprentice will have an interest in mental health counseling with this age group.  Each local early learning center will work with The Collective to develop a customized Mental Health Apprenticeship program.  As an undergraduate Mental Health apprentice you will receive generalized and individualized training for that specific early learning center in order to meet the mental health needs of their clients. Recruitment for Mental Health Apprenticeship positions will begin in the Spring 2025 semester.  As a Mental Health Apprentice, you would be paid by the program and receive graduated incentives from UMKC for your participation.

The members of The Collective include:
<UL>
<LI>the Early Childhood Innovation Center (ECIC) at the University of Missouri-Kansas City (UMKC) Institute for Human Development </LI>
<LI>Cornerstones of Care (CoC)</LI>
<LI>UMKC School of Education, Social Work and Psychological Sciences (ESWPS)</LI>
<LI>Missouri Association for Infant & Early Childhood Mental Health (MOAIMH)</LI>
<LI>Kansas Association for Infant & Early Childhood Mental Health (KAIMH)</LI>
<LI>Five early learning programs discussed in more details below.</LI>

<H2>1.	Is the Mental Health Apprenticeship the same as enrolling in UMKC’s PSYCH 461 – Field Practicum course in the Dept. of Psychology and Counseling?</H2>

No, the Mental Health Apprenticeship is not the same as enrolling in UMKC’s undergraduate PSYCH 461 Field Practicum course.  

<UL>
<LI>The Mental Health Apprenticeship is part of a funded research project that allows students to be paid for their participation. UMKC’s PSYCH 461 currently does not allow paid internships).</LI> 

<LI>Mental Health Apprenticeship will be paid employees at their respective early learning site. </LI>

<LI>In addition, Mental Health Apprenticeship will be paid above the prevailing wage for their participation in this project. They will also receive extensive training related to the project that can be transferable to careers in early childhood education.</LI>
</UL>

There are some similarities to UMKC’s undergraduate PSYCH 461 – Field practicum course. Mental Health Apprenticeship will:  
<UL>
<LI>Completing brief bi-monthly reflection assignments, </LI>
<LI>Meeting once a month to discuss your progress, challenges, and achievements.</LI>
<LI>Enrolling and having long-term access to a Canvas organization-styled course to access materials, upload brief assignments, communicate with fellow apprentice and ECMHCP staff.</LI>
</UL>
		
		
		
<H2>2.	What will I be able to do after completing this Apprenticeship?</H2>		

Students who complete our extensive training and participate in our program, will gain the knowledge, skills, and experience to assume roles in other early childhood programs that support infant, toddler, and pre-K mental health.

As an Apprentice, your training will allow you to earn endorsements in infant and early childhood education. Endorsements are not formal certificates but are similar to earning educational badges or micro-credentials that demonstrate competencies, skills, or knowledge in a particular subject area.


These trainings will include:
<UL>
<LI>Practice-Based Coaching, </LI>
<LI>CLASS Reliability, </LI>
<LI>Child Screening (ASQ-SE2), and </LI>
<LI>Reflective Supervision.</LI>
</UL>

You will also be asked to complete courses that complement your Apprenticeship experience and help you earn your endorsements. You may have taken these courses or plan to to take them. These include:

<UL>
<LI><b>PSYCH 222 - </B><I> Child Psychology</I> </LI>
<LI><b>PSYCH 323 - </B><I> Theory and Methods of Personality</I> </LI>
<LI><b>PSYCH 407 - </B><I> Cognitive Psychology</I> </LI>
<LI><b>PSYCH 433 - </B><I> Psychological Perspectives on Mental Health</I> </LI>
<LI><b>PSYCH 444 - </B><I> Introduction to Clinical Psychology</I> </LI>
</UL>

<H2>3.	What will my typical day look like?</H2>	

Your typical day will depend on the particular early learning site. You can find out more by reading or watching the linked videos below about each site. We also encourage you to ask any additional questions you may have about your role expectations during your interview.
In addition to your Apprenticeship experience, you will enroll in a Canvas organizational course. This is a non-credit course and you will not earn credit towards the 120 credits required for graduation at UMKC.  

However, the Canvas course will allow us to organize required activities,  meetings, and assignments. Specifically, apprentices will write bi-weekly reflections about their experiences. We will meet once a month via zoom to discuss your experiences at your site, address concern, and focus on developing new skills. Dr. Marte will offer Apprenticeship Office hours and you can also setup one-on-one meetings.
		





<H2>4.	Where will my Apprenticeship take place? Where do I apply?</H2>

There will 5 early learning sites, but only four are currently hosting Apprentices at this time.   To learn more about each site and how to successfully apply for an Apprenticeship, please visit the links below, for their specific requirements.


<H2>5. I've applied, what's next?</H2>
Be sure to email <A href="mailto:ricardomarte@umkc.edu?cc=marter@umsystem.edu&subject=ECMHCP%20Application%20Notice&body=Dr.Marte,%20I%20have%20applied%20to%20the%20following%20Apprenticeship%20site(s):">Dr. Marte</A>, to let him know you've applied so he can begin preparation for an online Canvas course.
